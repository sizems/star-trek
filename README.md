Project Overview
This will be a database of Star Trek ships, their crews, and other details.

Purpose
The purpose of this app is for entertainment. Some of the other ideas I had seemed to be too simple or boring. This is a topic that can easily be scaled as time/difficulty allows and will still allow me to have fun and show a bit of personality.

Project Layout
The navbar/header will contain the different governments (Federation, Klingon, Romulan, etc) that, when clicked, will produce a list of ships registered to that government (Ships component). The ship names can then be clicked to view crew members (Crew component). If time permits I will also add a feature to view photos and a short bio of the crew members (Bio component).

Technologies
I plan on primarily using TypeScript/Angular for the basic construction of the site. Details and design components will be added with CSS, JavaScript/JQuery, and HTML.

Approach
Separating the components by Governments, then Ships, then Crew seemed to make the most sense since they are easily broken down in that way. I wanted each of those to be their own component so that viewers can easily switch between items in the same category.

MVP
I am just starting to build the wireframe for this application but ideally, I would like to flesh it out with a sleek design, images, and possibly animations on click/transition between components.
