# Overview
Baby's first real Angular app. This was made as a project for a coding bootcamp. It serves as a (very incomplete) database of noteable ships from the various Star Trek series, as well as crew manifests for the Federation ships.

# Project Layout
The app is primarily categorized by Governments. The Federation category has additional pages detailing the crew members of the various ships.
Most of the data is hard-coded into the Angular app. There is some experimentation with Spring Boot and SQL, but those areas are not complete.

# Running the App
The app is not currently running online. This repo can be downloaded and running the command "ng serve -o" from inside the main folder will launch the app in a browser window.
